.. glossary::

	Apply
		Applies any changes made by the user to all the features for the INCID in the active feature in the main window. See :ref:`main_window` for more details.

	Boundary Importance
		The relative importance of each source when determining the boundary location of all the features in an INCID (e.g. of 'Primary' or 'Secondary' importance).

	Bulk Update
		Enables updates to the attributes for multiple selected INCIDs simultaneously. See :ref:`bulk_update_window` for more details.

	Determination Quality
		Categorises the accuracy with which a priority habitat has been determined (e.g. 'Definitely is the priority habitat'). See :ref:`determination_quality` for more details.

	Export
		Combines spatial data for the selected features from GIS with the associated attribute data from the database into a single new GIS layer based upon a pre-defined export format. See :ref:`export_window` for more details.

	Fragment ID
		An incremental number used as a unique reference to individual features (fragments) of a single TOID. See :ref:`habitat_framework` for more details.

	Habitat Class
		One of the habitat classification systems used in the UK to record or describe an area of habitat (e.g. 'Phase 1', 'NVC', 'BAP Priority').

	Habitat Importance
		The relative importance of each source when determining the IHS habitat and associated IHS codes for all the features in an INCID (e.g. of 'Primary' or 'Secondary' importance).

	Habitat Type
		The code and/or descriptive term of a habitat classification system that best represents an area of habitat (e.g. 'B312', 'CG2', 'Lowland Calcareous Grassland').

	IHS
		Integrated Habitat System - a hierarchical integration of existing habitat and land use classifications used in the UK. IHS was devised by the Somerset Environmental Records Centre.

	INCID
		An **Inc**\ remental **id**\ entifier used as a unique reference to a logical group of one or more features. See :ref:`incid` for more details.

	Interpretation Comment
		A free text field to explain or provide additional reasoning behind the priority habitat determination and interpretation.

	Interpretation Quality
		A combination of the assessment of the quality and age of the original source habitat identification and the relationship between the original habitat type and the priority habitat type. See :ref:`interpretation_quality` for more details.

	Logical Merge
		Combines all the attributes for the features selected in the GIS into a single INCID record of one of the selected features. See :ref:`logical_merge` for more details.

	Logical Split
		Creates a single new INCID record in the database for the features selected from an existing INCID in the GIS layer. See :ref:`logical_split` for more details.

	Merge
		The tool can perform two types of merge, Logical Merge or Physical Merge, depending upon the filter active in the tool. See :ref:`merge` for more details.

	Multiplex Codes
		Matrix, Formation, Management and Complex codes (known collectively as 'Multiplex' codes) can be recorded alongside an IHS Habitat code to refine the habitat definition for an INCID.

	Physical Split
		Creates one or more new TOID fragments in the database based upon a single TOID which has been split in the GIS layer. See :ref:`physical_split` for more details.

	Physical Merge
		Combines two or more fragments of a single TOID into a single, larger, feature in the GIS layer. See :ref:`physical_merge` for more details.

	Potential Priority Habitat
		Habitat areas that are close to, but do not currently meet, priority habitat definitions but may do with appropriate management or following habitat restoration work.

	Priority Habitat
		Habitats identified as requiring action in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP) and continue to be regarded as conservation priorities in the UHS Post-2010 Biodiversity Framework.

	Process
		The activity being undertaken that has lead to applying this change to the spatial or attribute data of the current INCID. It may relate to a specific project, an ongoing process or an adhoc update.

	Reason
		The underlying explanation for the change in habitat or land use. It may be as a result of known changes in the habitat (such as habitat restoration), because new information indicates the existing data is wrong or because there has been a change but the underlying the cause is unknown.

	Source
		A dataset, document or reference used as the source of habitat or land use information. Up to three sources can be defined for each INCID.

	Split
		The tool can perform two types of split, Logical Split or Physical Split, depending upon the filter active in the tool. See :ref:`split` for more details.

	TOID
		A unique *topographical identifier* applied to features in Ordnance Survey's MasterMap product. See :ref:`habitat_framework` for more details.

	Vague Date
		A specific date, range of dates or imprecise date that can be specified in a variety of formats (e.g. '23 Mar 1987', 'Mar 1987 - Jun 1987', 'Spring 1987').
